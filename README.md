# Childrens Matching Game

Greetings!  This matching game is built using raw HTML tags to be copy-pasta'd into an existing webpage that generated by Hostcentric (Or any other website generator that allows embedded HTML).

It should be kept relatively simple using standard HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.
